# Query-Smashgg-for-PR
This project aims to make it easier for community people getting PR related information from smash.gg. This is done through querying the smash.gg website through powershell.

# Input needed
The input of the scripts are two factors:
- All players that should be considered via a csv file 
- A list of smash.gg links of tournaments that should be considered for the data collection
(At the moment only the tournament name as used in the smash.gg link is required, will be determined what is most pratical there)

# Result
The result after running the script are two files with placements and losses for each player in the given list at the given tournaments
